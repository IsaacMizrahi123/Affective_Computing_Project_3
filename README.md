# Affective_Computing_Project_3
Python script that identifies (classify) pain from fused physiological data using Machine Learning.

To run the script: Project3.py <training_data> <testing_data>

Data types: Diastolic BP, Systolic BP, EDA, and Respiration. The data will be downsampled and normalized to later performe a score level fusion.
 
The output of the script is the accuracy of the score level fusion.

A project paper PDF file with the result and comparisong of the different approaches is included.
